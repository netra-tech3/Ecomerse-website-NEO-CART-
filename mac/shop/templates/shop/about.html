      <p>My NEO CART Cart Pvt Ltd. is an Indian electronic commerce website based in NOIDA, India. Founded by Netrapal singh, Kartik , Prakhar gupta in  2023 the company initially focused on book sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, and lifestyle products.

The service competes primarily with Amazon' s Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] as of March 2022, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[7] Flipkart is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[8] Flipkart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
